        <h2>What is a Repair Cafe?</h2>
        <p>A Repair Café is a community space where people can bring broken or damaged items to be fixed for free with the help of skilled volunteers. It’s more than just a place to repair things—it’s a hub for sustainability, education, and connection.</p>

        <p>The first Repair Cafe was held in 2009 in Amsterdam, and the movement has grown to over 2500 Repair Cafes worldwide!</p>
        
        <p>At the Nelson Repair Café, we are hoping to support items such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small appliances</strong> (e.g., toasters, blenders, lamps)</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing and textiles</strong> (e.g., torn pants, broken zippers, missing buttons)</li>
            <li><strong>Bikes and small tools</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Electronics</strong> (basic repairs)</li>
            <li><strong>Furniture or household items</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Our first Repair Cafe event saw a variety of items brought in for repair including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>shorts, shirt, pants, jackets, jumpers</li>
            <li>bags, jewelery, umbrellas </li>
            <li>sewing machines, fans, irons, speakers, lamps</li>
            <li>clocks, cameras, thermometers, toys</li>
            <li>phones, laptops, computers</li>
            <li>furniture, bowls, mugs</li>
            <li>bikes, chainsaw, scooter, generator</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Repair?</h2>
        <p>Every year, millions of items are discarded simply because they’re broken, even though many could be repaired. Repair Cafés help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce waste</strong>: By keeping items out of landfills.</li>
            <li><strong>Save money</strong>: Avoid the cost of replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn skills</strong>: Gain hands-on experience in repairing your own belongings.</li>
            <li><strong>Build community</strong>: Connect with like-minded individuals who care about sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bring Your Item</strong>: Drop in during our scheduled Repair Cafe events with your broken or damaged item.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborate on the Repair</strong>: Work alongside our skilled volunteers to fix the item together.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn and Connect</strong>: Ask questions, pick up new skills, and enjoy connecting with others in the community.</li>
            <!-- <li><strong>Pay It Forward</strong>: While our services are free, donations are welcome to help support the initiative.</li> -->
        </ol>
